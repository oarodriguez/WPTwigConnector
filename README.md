A library to create Wordpress themes using the Twig template engine
======================================================================

[Twig][1] is a great template engine, and [Wordpress][3] is a great blogging 
platform. However, Wordpress themes are a mess, mixing logic and presentation.
With WPTwigConnector you can create themes using the clear and simple syntax
of Twig, and keep your PHP out of your templates. 
 

Status
---------

The library is in a early state, but a few Wordpress functions can be used
in templates. See CHANGELOG for details.
